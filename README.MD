#Budget Tracker

A browser-based personal budgeting tool that lets users add and categorize expenses, view a running history, and see visual breakdowns of spending. This project demonstrates front-end web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€” including dynamic interactivity and data persistence.

#Project Description

Budget Tracker was built to showcase front-end development proficiency and apply key web programming concepts in a real-world scenario. The application allows users to:

- Add new expenses with category selection
- View a list of all recent expenses
- Analyze spending with visual charts
- Maintain data across sessions using `localStorage`

This project is fully responsive, user-friendly, and deployed on GitHub Pages.
